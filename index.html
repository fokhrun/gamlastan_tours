    <div class="tour-description">            
        <p> Discover the historical wonders of Stockholm on our guided tours. It takes visitors on a journey through medieval Stockholm. 
            The tours promise to provide an immersive experience of the city's history through sights, sounds, and flavors. 
            It encourages people to step back in time and explore the narrow, cobblestone streets where lords, ladies, and 
            shopkeepers once roamed. The old town, named locally as Gamlastan, is described as an ideal starting point for visitors to learn about Swedish 
            culture and the city's fascinating past. The tour begins at Stortorget, the main square, and includes stops at 
            the Royal Palace, where visitors can learn about Swedish royalty, and a sampling of traditional candy. 
            The tour concludes on the island of Riddarholmen, offering beautiful views and the oldest building in Stockholm.

        <p>We offer three types of tour:
          <ol>
            <li> <i>Gamlastan Classic</i> is the shortest form of the tour and recommended tour for those interested in experiencing the historical charm of the
              city but do not have a lot of time. It provides an opportunity to travel back in time, learn about Swedish history, and explore notable landmarks.
              The tour guides visitors through Stortorget, the Royal Palace, and various historical sites, ending on Riddarholmen Island. It promises an enriching 
              and enjoyable experience that captures the essence of medieval Stockholm.
            <li> <i>Gamlastan PubCrawl</i> is a bit longer than the classic one and goes through the same route, but makes stops at five different well known 
              pubs for sufficient time to get a pint of beer or a glass of wine at each one.
            <li> <i>Gamlastan Delux</i>: is the longest that goes through the same route, but makes stops at the Nobel museum and its cafe where tourists can learn about 
              Nobel prize winners and take a bite to eat at the center of Gamlastan.
