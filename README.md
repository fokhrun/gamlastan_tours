## Testing 

We have loaded the sites in different types of devices including Macbook, Windows laptop, IPhone, and Android phones. The text wraps nicely in the landing section seamlessly depending on the size of the screen and the images load appropriately. Also the links work perfectly and navigates to the appropriate section upon click. The forms element provides sufficient guide to provide correct input. Furthermore, we have tested with other users. The texts are readable and the users gave the feedback that the site is clutter free.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
